# TeamRank

This tool calculates the average rank and LP of a League of Legends team and compares it to the threshold for tournament eligibility.

2. Place League of Legends rank images in the `images/RankIcons` folder (e.g., `Diamond.webp`, `Master+.webp`,...).
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.
4. Select player ranks and LPs, and the tool will calculate the team’s average LP and compare it to the threshold.
